# Newyorktimes-Project
This is the project of Hauke Schnepel, Claudio Vassallo, Dennis Philip Erni. The project exist of one notebook with all the code, one .txt-file with bestseller data from the new york times, and a readme with a step by step manual.

For the functionality of the code, we kept to a large extent to the specifications of the task description. However, it was very important to us that the code runs very well and securely on the one hand, and on the other hand we wanted to refresh the input and output a little graphically. We hope that we have achieved our two goals in your opinion. 

# Instructions on how to run the code
First, the tkinter and datetime libraries must be installed. We have included two instructions below to install the two libraries.

## Instructions on how to install tkinter
Tkinter comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for Mac OS X and the Windows platform. 
So if you install Python from the official binaries for Mac OS X or Windows platform, 
you are good to go with Tkinter.
For Debian versions of Linux you have to install it manually by using the following commands.
For Python 3 --> sudo apt-get install python3-tk
For Python 2.7 --> sudo apt-get install python-tk
